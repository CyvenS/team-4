# Our Game Idea
Our game is a 2D top-down, competitive bullet hell style game called “Pistol Shrimp”, inspired by “Squirrel with a gun” and “Journey of the Prairie King”. Player’s will be taking control of a shrimp that got their claws on a pistol that’s been seemingly discarded in the ocean, and use it against some of the bigger predators. 

The main objective of the game is to last as long as possible against the onslaught of enemies that appear within 60 seconds or longer than the other player.   

# Objective Statement/Project Goals
The goal for the project is to create a fun, and competitive gameplay loop for people to enjoy, even if they get frustrated and losing, come out enjoying themselves. 

Create interesting and memorable control schemes for players, having balance between movement and general gameplay. 

# Design Rationale? 
We envision for our game design to be a split-screen design as to prevent the two players from interfering from each other during their gameplay. The movement is determined by rotating the joystick to orient the character, a button input to swim around, the other to be the pistol fire so that the 8 direction movement is implemented with our setting.

There will be only a couple enemy types, one being a whale that covers most of the screen, almost as a level hazard that will harm both enemies and players. The other general enemy type is the shark as a natural predator (enemy) to shrimps. In terms of any additional enemy types or powerups, these are the stretch goals.
